├── tests
│   └── test_example.cairo   # Test cases for the smart contract
├── Scarb.toml       # Configuration file for the Cairo project

```

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for Cairo development.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage Guidelines

- To run the main application, execute the `main.cairo` file.
